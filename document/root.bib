Together, these three techniques constitute Directed Automated Random Testing, or DART for short. The main strength of DART is thus that testing can be performed completely automatically on any program that compiles -- there is no need to write any test driver or harness code. During testing, DART detects standard errors such as program crashes, assertion violations, and non-termination. Preliminary experiments to unit test several examples of C programs are very encouraging.}, journal = {SIGPLAN Not.}, month = {jun}, pages = {213–223}, numpages = {11}, keywords = {program verification, interfaces, automated test generation, random testing, software testing} }

Properties are described as Haskell functions, and can be automatically tested on random input, but it is also possible to define custom test data generators. We present a number of case studies, in which the tool was successfully used, and also point out some pitfalls to avoid. Random testing is especially suitable for functional programs because properties can be stated at a fine grain. When a function is built from separately tested components, then random testing suffices to obtain good coverage of the definition under test.}, journal = {SIGPLAN Not.}, month = {sep}, pages = {268–279}, numpages = {12} }
