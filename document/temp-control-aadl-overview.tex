Figure~\ref{fig:temp-control-graphical} presents the AADL graphical
view for a simple temperature control system that maintains a
temperature according to a set point containing high and low bounds
for the target temperature.
The periodic \texttt{tempSensor} thread measures the temperature and
transmits the reading on its \texttt{currentTemp} data port.  It sends
a notification on its \texttt{tempChanged} event port if it detects
that the temperature has changed since the last reading.  When the
sporadic (event-driven) \texttt{tempControl} thread receives a
\texttt{tempChanged} event, it reads the value on its
\texttt{currentTemp} data port and compares it with the most recent
set point.  If the current temperature exceeds the high set point or 
drops below the low set point, the fan is turned on or off respectively. 
In turn, the fan acknowledges these commands.
%% sends a \texttt{FanCmd.On} command to cool the temperature.

%% Similar
%% logic will result in \texttt{FanCmd.Off} being sent if the current
%% temperature is below the low set point.  In either case, the
%% \texttt{fan} acknowledges whether it was able to fulfill the command
%% by sending \texttt{FanAck.Ok} or \texttt{FanAck.Error} on its
%% \texttt{fanAck} event data port.

\caption{Temperature Control Thread -- AADL Textual View}
\label{fig:temp-control-thread-textual}
\end{figure}

AADL's textual view for the component type definition of the \texttt{TempControl}
thread is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:temp-control-thread-textual}.
Because \texttt{TempControl} is event-triggered, it will be dispatched
by arrival of events on any of the \texttt{tempChanged}, \texttt{fanAck}, 
\texttt{setPoint} ports.  Most interesting for us is the dispatching on the 
arrival of the \texttt{tempChanged} event.  In this case, the 
thread application logic will read the \texttt{currentTemp} data port, 
compare the value to the most recent \texttt{setPoint} values, and
compute an appropriate state for the fan, sending an on/off command
over the \texttt{fanCmd} port if necessary.
